    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h4 id="heading">PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLOUD COMPUTING</h4>
    <p>The Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) was launched by the President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, to promote education, research and business opportunities in Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Internet of Things, and Cloud Native Computing. The initiative comes in a bid to enable Pakistan in making an imprint on the world's path towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution.It aims to transform the fields of :</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
        <li>Block Chain</li>
        <li>Internet of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing </b> program prepares the students to program in open source technologies like,
        <b>Linux,Docker,Kubernates,Javascript,Node.js , React and react Native</b> while introducing the students to
        development of Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>The <b>Artificial Intelligence </b>program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology
        , via teaching programming in open source like <b>Python, Numpy, Pandas,Tensorflow 2.0 and Flash </b>and teaching deploying
        practical AI solutions and use cases ans ending with real-life example of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Block Chain</h2>
    <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger(fabric),
        and learn to program in languages such as <b>Solidity,Javascript on frameworks like Node.js</b>. The program also
        introduce them to development of Distributed Apps(DApps),frameworks like web3 and Truffle and an in-depth
        understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service(BaaS) and how to develop and offer an initial Coin Offering
        (ICO) of a cryto-token    </p>

     <h2>Internet Of Things:</h2>   
     <p>The <b>Internet of Things</b> program introduces the students toopen source development technologies like <b>Rust,
        EMbedded Rust,WebAssembly,Hyper,Diesel,Google Assistant and Kubernates  </b> while making them efficient 
        in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge,IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control</p>
